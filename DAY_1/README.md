# Day 1 of 100 Days 100 Code 
Today is the first day and we are going to build AM4 aarch
## AM4 Aarch

# 🚀 AM5 (Algo Model 5) – The next major version of AM4

AM5 is the **next-generation upgrade** to **AM4 (Algoritms Model 4)** , bringing **self-improvement, modular expansion, and advanced NLP techniques** to create a more **adaptive, efficient, and long-lasting AI**.
AM5 is also known as AM4 2.0

## 🔥 Key Enhancements in AM5 vs AM4

| Feature | **AM4 (Algoritms Model 4)** | **AM5 (Algoritms Model 5)** |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **NLP Foundation** | Word Groups (Nodes) & Pattern Recognition | **Word Groups + Thesaurus API + Levenshtein + Soundex + Metaphone** |
| **Self-Improvement** | ❌ Not available | ✅ **User-defined corrections & feedback loop for learning** |
| **Modular Design** | ❌ Static AI model | ✅ **Dynamic Plugin System (Real-time expansions)** |
| **Knowledge Update** | **Predefined responses only** | ✅ **Learns new facts from user feedback (doesn't need frequent retraining)** |
| **Customization** | Fixed logic | ✅ **Users can train AI from the frontend (crowdsourced training)** |
| **Memory Management** | Fast NLP processing | ✅ **Improved memory recall with decision trees for better learning** |
| **Training Requirement** | AI must be recompiled for updates | ✅ **No re-training needed; plugins keep it updated for decades** |

## 🧠 How AM5 Works

### 1️⃣ NLP Engine Upgraded
AM5 integrates **4 new linguistic techniques** to improve **accuracy, spelling correction, and phonetic recognition**:
- **Thesaurus API** → Finds synonyms and related words to expand recognition.
- **Levenshtein Distance** → Corrects misspellings by measuring word similarity.
- **Soundex & Metaphone** → Recognizes similar-sounding words, improving speech-to-text accuracy.

---

### 2️⃣ Basic Learning (Self-Improvement)
**AM5 learns from users without needing backend retraining.**  
- If AM5 is **wrong**, the **user corrects it**, and the AI **stores the correction**.  
- AI **refines future responses** based on past feedback.  
- **No need for deep learning or frequent retraining!**  

📌 **Example:**
```plaintext
👤: "Who is the CEO of Tesla?"
🤖: "I don't know."
👤: "It's Elon Musk."
🤖 (Stores this information for future use.)
```

### 3️⃣ Modular Plugin System (Infinite Expansion)
AM5 is modular—it doesn’t require huge retraining cycles.
Users can install small plugins (40-50 lines of code) to enhance functionality!

#### 📌 Example Plugins:

##### Plugin	Function
Math Plugin	Allows AM5 to do calculations
Weather Plugin	Fetches real-time weather updates from Google/DuckDuckGo/Bing
News Plugin	Fetches live news data
Custom AI Trainer Plugin	Allows users to train AM5 through frontend without backend recompilation
✨ This means AM5 can keep learning for years, even decades!
Instead of retraining the entire AI, we just add new plugins.

🔥 Why AM5 is Revolutionary
✅ More powerful NLP – Supports thesaurus-based expansion, spell correction, and phonetics.
✅ Self-learning AI – No need for backend retraining! Users can train AI in real-time.
✅ Modular & Scalable – New plugins = new abilities. AM5 can keep improving without deep learning.
✅ AI for decades, not months – No need for frequent AI training cycles. Just add plugins!

🚀 The Future of AM5
Crowdsourced AI Training – Users worldwide can improve AM5 without backend access.
Infinite Expansion – Anyone can develop small, lightweight plugins to add new AI features.
Ultra-Low Resource AI – Unlike GPT & LLaMA, AM5 can run on low-end hardware and still be highly efficient.
👑 AM5 = The AI That Grows Forever!
This is the next step in building a long-lasting, self-improving LLM without expensive GPU training! 🚀🔥
